# Continuous Integration Systems (CIs Justification)

First part:
We will use two continuous integration systems:

- Travis CI .
- CircleCI . 

Second part:
Find alternatives for the Travis and try to use it for the test purposes.
There are several alternatives for Travis like TeamCity,Jenjkins and Appveyors; but I will use Appveyor specifically for the test purposes.


# Travis CI:
I follow this [documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) to setup and connect my GitHub Account with Travis CI Account.
When I authorize Travis to access my repository, I have to select it to be activated with each push.
